Description:
============

 Patch XT*7.3*107 (Eclipse M-Debugger)
  
 This patch contains nine routines (XTDEBUG,XTDEBUG1,...XTDEBUG8), eight 
 REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994) entries, and does not have a context 
 option, since only individuals who hold the XUPROGMODE key would be 
 expected to use the Eclipse M-Debugger.
  
 The routines provide the server side capability for a visual debugger for 
 the M language in the Eclipse IDE.
